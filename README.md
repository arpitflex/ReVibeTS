Ensure that on trying to run this bot, a `.env` file is populated with the Discord Bot's token set as `CLIENT_TOKEN`.

For example:
```
# discord bot credentials, get it from discord developer portal:
# https://discord.com/developers/applications
CLIENT_TOKEN=NzkyNzE1NDU0MTk2MDg4ODQy.X-hvzA.Ovy4MCQywSkoMRRclStW4xAYK7I
```
